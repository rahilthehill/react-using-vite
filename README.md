# How to create a React app created using VITE
[Threejs-Journey-Lesson-41](https://threejs-journey.com/lessons/first-react-application#)

## NOTES

### Process
1. Following the Vite documentation [ViteDocs](https://vitejs.dev/guide/)
2. Create project by running `npm create vite@latest`
3. But more about  `npm create`, it's a alias for  `npm init`, so calling `npm create vite@latest` your actually just doing `npm init vite@latest`
4. `npm init` will add the `create-` automatically, so it's actually using the `create-vite` package in npm
5. Then a few questions will be there in the terminal, so just answer them based on what you want. 
6. Make sure to create this in the overall folder of the project, as it will create the folder of the project itself in that folder, which you can then enter and start 
7. So for the first time, just enter `y` then the `project-name`, and choose `react` and then just choose the `javascript` variant
8. use `cd project-name`
9. run `npm run dev`
10. open the given link by vite in the terminal in your browser


### Pros & Cons
Vite is fast. Simple to set up.
Might have the same issue with cleaning up existing files like with using NPX and updating directories etc...
